# Jump
In the beginning, we were trying to build a jump-related game. Jump distance depends on the data read from the sensor when the user is carrying a sensor and making a physical jump. When the user jumps too far or too late will cause the failure of reaching the platform and then lose the game.

But after 3 days trying, we think we are not able to learn openGL and complete this game within the specified date. So we decided to change our project idea o build a running-related project. It can trace the user's running route and draw it on the map and implement as many functions as possible from the sensor. We know that our idea is kind of conventional, but we will make the UI as beautiful as possible.
